### Introduction
With increased popularity and growth in event-based online services like [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/), it has also become difficult for users to find the events that match their interests. Building a strong recommendation engine would be the natural answer to this problem. However, this is different from the classic recommendation scenarios (music, movies etc.) where there are explicit ratings for the items to be recommended. In this case, the events or groups to be recommended cannot be rated before it has occured, so we use certain implicit feedback data as a proxy for the users' intention or propensity towards a certain event/group.

In this project, we collected data using the [Meetup API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) for the groups, events and members in the Austin, TX area. We use two different kinds of implicit feedback data - RSVPs and TimeDelta to build and analyze the performance and limitations of several well known recommendation algorithms. Finally, we tie this together with how Meetup can generate more revenue through user engagement which is facilitated by recommending personalized groups and events to the members.
